# SEO-002: Add JSON-LD Structured Data

**Status**: Complete
**Created**: 2026-01-29
**Completed**: 2026-01-29

## 1. Goal

Add JSON-LD structured data to `index.html` with `Person` and `WebSite` schema types to improve search result appearance with rich snippets (name, job title, social links).

## 2. Approach

Single `<script type="application/ld+json">` block in `<head>` using `@graph` to combine both schemas.

**Approaches Considered**:
1. **Single `@graph` block** — Pros: Clean, one script tag, standard pattern / Cons: None significant
2. **Separate script tags** — Pros: Easier to manage individually / Cons: More DOM elements, no real benefit
3. **Microdata in HTML** — Pros: No extra script / Cons: Clutters HTML, harder to maintain, less tooling support

**Chosen**: Approach 1 — `@graph` is the recommended pattern for multiple entities on one page.

## 3. Implementation

### Changes Made

**`index.html`** (lines 56-79):
- Added `<script type="application/ld+json">` after canonical link
- `Person` schema: name, jobTitle, url, email, sameAs (GitHub, LinkedIn)
- `WebSite` schema: name, url

### Data Sources (from existing HTML)
- Name: "Alexey Minakov" (from `<h1>` and meta tags)
- Job title: "Software Developer" (from hero subtitle)
- URL: https://goodalex223.github.io (from canonical link)
- Email: alexminak32@gmail.com (from contact section)
- GitHub: https://github.com/GoodAlex223 (from contact section)
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexey-minakov-302457168 (from contact section)

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] JSON-LD script in `<head>` of `index.html`
- [x] `Person` schema with name, jobTitle, url, sameAs (GitHub, LinkedIn)
- [x] `WebSite` schema with name and url
- [ ] Validates at schema.org/validator or Google Rich Results Test (requires deployment)

## 5. Future Improvements

1. **Add `knowsAbout` property** — List skills (Python, Arduino, TypeScript) in the Person schema for richer knowledge panel data
2. **Add `ItemList` schema for projects** — Structure project cards as a `CollectionPage` with `ItemList` for better search engine understanding of portfolio content
3. **Validate after deployment** — Run through Google Rich Results Test once merged to main
