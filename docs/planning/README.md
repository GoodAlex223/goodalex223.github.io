## Documents

| [DONE.md](DONE.md) | Completed tasks |
| [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) | Future ideas and improvements |
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | Long-term vision |

## Workflow

```
Idea → BACKLOG.md → Prioritized → TODO.md → In Progress → DONE.md
```

1. New ideas go to `BACKLOG.md`
2. When prioritized, move to `TODO.md`
3. When complete, move to `DONE.md`
