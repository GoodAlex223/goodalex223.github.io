# Active Implementation Plans

This directory contains active task implementation plans.

---

## Purpose

Plans document the implementation approach for tasks before coding begins:
- Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Technical approach and alternatives considered
- Edge cases and risks
- Execution log tracking progress

---

## Plan Template

New plans should follow this structure:

```
# [Task ID]: [Task Title]

**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: Planning | In Progress | Complete
**Priority**: High | Medium | Low

---

## 1. Goal
[What we're trying to achieve]

## 2. Requirements
[Acceptance criteria, constraints]

## 3. Implementation Plan
[Phases, steps, technical approach]

## 4. Technical Specifications
[Details, code structure, data formats]

## 5. Future Improvements
[Ideas discovered during implementation]

## Execution Log
[Running log of progress, decisions, blockers]
```

---

## Lifecycle

```
1. Create plan in this directory
2. Update docs/README.md with active plan link
3. Work on implementation, updating execution log
4. On completion: move to ../archive/plans/
5. Update TODO.md → DONE.md
```
