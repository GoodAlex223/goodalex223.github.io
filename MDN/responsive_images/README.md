# [Responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

__Objective__:  Learn how to use features like srcset and the `<picture>` element to implement responsive image solutions on websites.

## Active learning: Implementing your own responsive images

- [x] Write some simple HTML to contain your code (use not-responsive.html as a starting point, if you like).
- [x] Find a nice wide screen landscape image with some kind of detail contained in it somewhere. Create a web-sized version of it using a graphics editor, then crop it to show a smaller part that zooms in on the detail, and create a second image (about 480px wide is good for this).

- [x] Use the `<picture>` element to implement an art direction picture switcher!
- [x] Create multiple image files of different sizes, each showing the same picture.
- [x] Use srcset/size to create a resolution switcher example, either to serve the same size image at different resolutions, or different image sizes at different viewport widths.
